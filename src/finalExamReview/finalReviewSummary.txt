Final exam: Wednesday, December 9
    - can start anytime that day
    - will have 2 hours to take exam once you start
    - make sure to start by 10:00 pm

Cumulative. 20% of your final grade.
    - Exams 1 and 2 were each 17.5% of your final grade
    - Final exam is in a different category in Canvas
    - I recommend pulling up all three proof guides
        - propositional logic
        - predicate logic
        - programming logic
    - I'll post a blank Logika project for you to clone beforehand
    - I recommend looking at all exam 1 and exam 2 solutions
        and reviewing all homework solutions

Topics:
    - Logical reasoning, knights and knaves
    - Truth tables
    - Translating between English and propositional logic
    - Proofs in propositional logic
    - Translating between English and predicate logic
    - Proofs in predicate logic
    - Programming logic
        - Assume, assert
        - Algebra, subst
        - Validating programs to get asserts to hold at the end:
            - Programs with variable assignments/updates (manual mode)
            - Programs with conditional statements (manual mode)
            - Programs with function contracts and loops (manual mode and symexe mode)
                - Writing function contracts
                - Writing loop invariants
            - Functions with sequences (symexe mode)
            - Programs with global invariants and possibly multiple functions (symexe mode)
        - Proving total correctness by adding proof of termination

Review problems.
    - these do not cover all possible problems!
    - please also review past exam solutions, past HW solutions, past lecture/recitation
